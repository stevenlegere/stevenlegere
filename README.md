Here are some ideas to get you started:

I'm a Junior developer trained in Full Stack Software Development at the esteemed School of Code, chosen from over 3500 applicants, I am now looking to firmly embed myself in the tech industry. During my studies I found myself most excited and driven by the various methods of testing, working tirelessly with Reacts Testing Library it has given me the foundations to make an immediate impact in the tech industry.

Before the School of Code, I was the Picture Editor of Metro.co.uk, succeeding in a highly efficient and driven environment. I also hold a 1st Class BA HONS degree in Visual Communication from Birmingham City University.
